 🏥 Hospital Performance Analysis Dashboard

This project analyses hospital data to uncover key insights about **hospital-incurred costs**, **patient satisfaction**, and **readmission rates**. Using Python for data analysis and Tableau for visualisation, it identifies patterns across patient demographics, treatment types, and outcomes, and offers data-driven recommendations to improve operational efficiency and patient experience.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The Tableau dashboard visualises how cost, satisfaction, and readmission vary with:

- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Condition**
- **Procedure**
- **Outcome**

### 🔍 Key Findings
- **Higher hospital costs** are linked to **better outcomes**, but not always **higher satisfaction**.
- **Older patients** have higher readmission risks, lower satisfaction, and incur more cost.
- **Female patients** report higher satisfaction but drive more cost and readmission.
- Some **procedures** are low-cost and high-satisfaction, while others underperform on both.

---

## 💡 Recommendations
- **Optimise care pathways** for high-cost, low-satisfaction procedures.
- **Enhance follow-up care** for older patients to reduce readmissions.
- **Address gender-specific care needs** to improve outcomes and reduce inefficiencies.
- **Replicate best practices** from low-cost, high-satisfaction procedures across departments.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, Seaborn, Statsmodels)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Tableau** (interactive dashboard)
- **Scikit-learn** (label encoding, clustering)
- **Statistical methods** (ANOVA, logistic regression)
